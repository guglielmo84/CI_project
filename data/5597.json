The researcher was unable to provide the Dot with evidence of the breach because he delete the database from his own computer\u00a0shortly after realizing the leaked data pertained to minors.\u201cThe sheer volume of private student data, including [test] scores and social security numbers for children, convinced me that it should be purged from my storage in an expedited fashion,\u201d Vickery said.The Daily Dot was unable to immediately confirm which U.S. schools\u00a0may have been affected. However,\u00a0Vickery confirmed (and praised) the swift action of Schoolzilla, which he said corrected the issue and secured the students\u2019 information within 24 hours. \u201cAs soon as we learned of it, we immediately fixed the error and confirmed no one accessed any information, other than the researcher,\u201d the company said.Unfortunately, that\u2019s an atypical response. It is a common issue that many companies respond with suspicion when reached by outside security researchers reporting vulnerabilities that expose their customers\u2019 data. In contrast, Schoolzilla responded to his notification appropriately, Vickery said, and took immediate action to secure its data. \u00a0\u201cThis was the first situation of its kind for them and they reacted professionally,\u201d Vickery said. \u201cIt must have been grueling for the CEO to phone each client and relay the unpleasant news, but they did it within only a few days of my report.\u201d", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/1-3-million-american-students-exposed-data-breach-now-secured/", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 37.810299, "Longitude": -122.265998}
