The breach was a spam campaign showing that            the intruders successfully harvested e-mail addresses from the Web site,            although it's not clear if SSNs were also obtained. The spam purported            to be a response to a job inquiry and requested more personal information.            Aetna sent letters last week notifying the 65,000 people whose SSNs            were on the site of the breach. UPDATE           (6/11/09):           Hartford health insurer Aetna Inc. is being sued. The class-action suit            was filed in a Pennsylvania District Court and demands credit monitoring,            punitive damages, costs and other relief for current, former and potential            employees.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 41.763711, "Longitude": -72.685093}
