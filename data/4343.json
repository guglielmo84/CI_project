Those sources said they were seeing a pattern of fraud on customer credit and debit cards that suggested a breach at some IHG properties \u2014 particularly Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express locations.Asked about the fraud patterns reported by my sources, a spokesperson for IHG said the company had received similar reports, and that it has hired an outside security firm to help investigate. IHG also issued the following statement:\u201cIHG takes the protection of payment card data very seriously.\u00a0We were made aware of a report of unauthorized charges occurring on some payment cards that were recently used at a small number of U.S.-based hotel locations. \u00a0We immediately launched an investigation, which includes retaining a leading computer security firm to provide us with additional support.\u00a0\u00a0We continue to work with the payment card networks.\u201d\u201cWe are\u00a0committed to\u00a0swiftly resolving\u00a0this\u00a0matter.\u00a0In the meantime, and in line with best practice, we recommend that individuals closely monitor their payment card account statements.\u00a0\u00a0If there are unauthorized charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank.
