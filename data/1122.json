Anyone could have read the published list of non-profits facing revocation of non-profit status and realized that there was an opportunity to register under their name.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 38.895112, "Longitude": -77.036366}
