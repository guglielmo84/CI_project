But  contrary to previous published reports, there is no indication Citrix or  its platforms have been compromised, he said. \u201cCitrix can confirm the recent incident was a password re-use attack,  where attackers used usernames and passwords leaked from other websites  to access the accounts of GoToMyPC users,\u201d Bennett wrote in an emailed  statement. \u201cAt this time, the response includes a mandatory password  reset for all GoToMyPC users. Citrix encourages customers to visit the\u00a0  GoToMyPC status page to learn about enabling two-step verification, and to use strong passwords in order to keep accounts as safe as possible. \u201dMore Information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/category/data-breaches/", "Information Source": "Krebs On Security", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 37.354108, "Longitude": -121.955236}
