Old credit card information and corresponding home addresses for orders from the CSLEA online store were also obtained. \u00a0Though the ordering process and encryption of credit card information were eventually taken over by Wells Fargo Bank, the card info was inadvertently placed back onto the CSLEA server when the web hosting service restored the site from an earlier version. \u00a0It is unclear how old the credit card information was. \u00a0CSLEA attempted to prevent hackers from accessing information after the November breach, but Anonymous was able to get past new passwords, obtain information, and release it around December 31.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 38.581572, "Longitude": -121.4944}
