The problem surfaced when former National City  customers began reporting unauthorized charges on their accounts. The breach  involves a small number of cards in the Cincinnati area, and it appears to have  been committed by someone outside PNC or National City prior to the merger. It  doesn\u2019t involve any PNC-branded cards or longtime PNC customers. PNC has shut  down National City debit cards in the Cincinnati area and asks that customers  who have not yet done so activate their PNC debit cards. PNC is working  one-on-one with customers to refund accounts, and has been returning funds  within 24 hours.UPDATE (10/19/10): Three men were charged with using skimming devices at PNCs in Pittsburgh in April and May.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 39.758948, "Longitude": -84.191607}
