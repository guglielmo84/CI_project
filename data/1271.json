The lawsuit alleges that Accretive violated state and federal health privacy laws, state debt collection laws, and state consumer protection laws. \u00a0It seeks an order requiring Accretive to fully disclose to patients: 1) what information it has about Minnesota patients; 2) what information it has lost about Minnesota patients; 3) where and to whom it has sent information about Minnesota patients; and 4) the purposes for which it amasses and uses information about Minnesota patients. In addition, the lawsuit asks Accretive to disclose whether it has sent health data about Minnesota patients to an offshore site in new Delhi, India and requests that restrictions be applied to how Accretive treats and uses patient data.The press release from the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson can be found here.UPDATE\u00a0(08/24/2012): A settlement agreement with Accretive Health was announced at the end of July. \u00a0The settlement requires Accretive to stop doing business in Minnesota for two years and to pay approximately $2.5 million to the State of Minnesota, a portion of which will be used to compensate patients.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 37.09024, "Longitude": -95.712891}
