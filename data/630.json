We immediately engaged an independent technical security expert to investigate this incident. We also contacted state and federal law enforcement and continue to work closely with them on their investigations.\u00a0What information was involved.\u00a0Based on the available information, we believe data relating to approximately 800 residents may have been inappropriately acquired. We do not know when this took place. We currently believe that a limited number of the inappropriately acquired files contained some combination of resident names with social security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance carrier and account numbers, and/or limited medical information, such as admission dates, diagnoses, medications, and/or procedures. Based on available information, we do not believe bank account numbers or any other financial information is impacted.\"", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/S027_v05.pdf_Resident%20Notice%20FINAL_1.pdf", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 37.338208, "Longitude": -121.886329}
