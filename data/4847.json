Plaintiffs in the suit are claiming that Netflix has \u201cperpetrated the largest voluntary privacy breach to date.\u201d According to the Complaint, Netflix knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the sensitive and personal information of approximately 480,000 Netflix subscribers when Netflix provided participants in a contest initiated to improve Netflix\u2019s movie recommendation systems with data sets containing over 100 million subscriber movie ratings and preferences. Netflix has claimed that the data sets provided to the contest participants were anonymized and that the subscribers\u2019 movie ratings were accompanied only by \u201ca numeric identifier unique to the subscriber\u201d (as opposed to the subscriber\u2019s name or other personal information). However, the complaint cites the results of several researchers who, in fact, were able to crack Netflix\u2019s anonymization process and identify individual subscribers.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 37.226611, "Longitude": -121.97468}
