An investigation determined the report was placed on obscure -- though publicly accessible -- Web pages because of human error, according to a university news release. The information was accessible for about eight months, although there is no evidence of its use, officials said. The university estimates that personally identifiable data for 4,500 students were in the report. Those affected include undergraduate students who attended the university from 1997 to 2006.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 21.306944, "Longitude": -157.858333}
