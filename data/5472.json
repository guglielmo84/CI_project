Please note that our credit card information is stored in a separate system designed for credit card storage and is not impacted by this possible breach.\u201d\u201cAlthough current passwords are stored salted and encrypted, we are accelerating our move to stronger password encryption at the same time in order to minimize disruption. In order to safeguard the system, we will force all users with older password encryption to change their passwords,\u201d it added.This is a fairly minor breach and the main outcome \u2013 if crooks manage to get their hands on the potentially exposed contact info \u2013 is more convincing phishing emails.\"More information: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/27/cpanel_security_breach/", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 29.808178, "Longitude": -95.444629}
