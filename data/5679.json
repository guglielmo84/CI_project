It has since been eliminated. We have quarantined the infected server and reinforced all relevant system structures.\u201dThe affected users entered their card information on OnePlus\u2019s store between mid-November and January. Customers who made purchases with a saved card \u201cshould not\u201d be affected, OnePlus said. The same goes for ones who paid with PayPal or credit card via PayPal.
