It appears that a former SEC employee inadvertently and unknowingly downloaded the names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth of SEC employees onto a thumb drive and then transferred them to another agency. \u00a0The employee wanted a template of the document rather than the actual employee data that it contained. \u00a0The accidental upload of sensitive information occured in April of 2012 and again in June of either 2012 or 2013. \u00a0Employees who were with SEC before October of 2009 were affected. The breach lasted for 10 months before being noticed. The SEC confiscated the flash drive when the breach was uncovered.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2013, "Latitude": 38.907192, "Longitude": -77.036871}
