We            received a print job and were running it, and there was an equipment            malfunction, Thompson said. In restarting the piece of equipment,            a mistake was made and it started one page off. It was an error and            our quality assurance didn't pick it up. Recipients received one            page with their own information and another page with information belonging            to a different person.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 44.310624, "Longitude": -69.77949}
