Some records contained the Social Security numbers,              grades, signatures and even psychological reports of former students              of the public intermediate high school. The boxes contained hundreds of records and were sitting next              to a trash bin filled with old desks and other discarded school supplies.              The School for the Physical City moved to a new location over the              summer and apparently the records were thrown out with the trash during              the relocation.\u00a0UPDATE (9/12/10): A parent and child are suing the New York City Department of Education.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 40.714269, "Longitude": -74.005973}
