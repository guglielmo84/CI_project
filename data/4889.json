The company even created reports for students that did not exist by using the information of real students. \u00a0Hundreds of thousands of dollars may have been fraudulently obtained over multiple years. The fraud was discovered in 2010. \u00a0Divine is located in multiple states and the corporate office denied any control over the day-to-day operations of Divine Sports in Miami.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2012, "Latitude": 25.788969, "Longitude": -80.226439}
