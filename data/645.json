As a result of that investigation it was determined that an unauthorized individual had accessed a C&T network drive between January 27, 2017, and February 2, 2017. C&T, however, could not determine whether any specific files were accessed.\u00a0 The network drive, unfortunately, contained the Company\u2019s 401K audit files for certain years.Upon receiving C&T\u2019s notification of a potential data breach, Performant undertook its own investigation to determine what specific information may have been compromised.\u00a0 Performant attempted multiple times to obtain specific answers and definitive records from C&T to accurately determine whose information may have been compromised. Performant also attempted to gain details regarding C&Ts incident notification procedure, including information about C&T\u2019s notification to employees of its client\u2019s employees, such as Performant\u2019s employees participating in the Company\u2019s 401K plan.\u00a0 On June 27, 2017, C&T, for the first time, provided Performant with access to the Company\u2019s specific files stored on the C&T network drive that was compromised.\u00a0 After receiving the files, Performant engaged in a detailed review to determine what, if any, personal information of its current or former employees was potentially compromised. The review revealed that your information may have been compromised by the incident at C&T.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Information Was Involved? Although C&T cannot determine whether or not Performant\u2019s files were accessed by the unauthorized individual, the security incident may have involved your first name, last name, date of birth, and Social Security number, as a result of your participation in the Company\u2019s 401K plan in the years of 2010, 2011, and/or 2015.\u00a0\u00a0 Please note that the data files related to this incident did not include other information about the 401K plan or information about your personal 401K, such as account access information or account balances.\" \u00a0", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-101052", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 39.103118, "Longitude": -84.51202}
