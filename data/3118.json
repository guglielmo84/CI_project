Someone had dumped hundreds of files of people's personal information. The manila folders that were found contained personal information of AT&T cell phone customers, including credit card numbers, driver's licenses and Social Security numbers. It appears the information was collected by another company called Ferrell Communication, which was located in a strip mall. It's no longer there, and the phone number listed isn't valid. The information is contracts for AT&T wireless service customers dating back to 1999 or 2000. The information is old, but could still be valid.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 30.332184, "Longitude": -81.655651}
