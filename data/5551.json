The cybersecurity breach at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was detected in September while the agency was undertaking a retrospective two-year review of employees downloading information in an effort to help minimize cyberthreats. The breach, flagged to Congress and three other government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, occurred in November 2015 when a former employee downloaded a large number of files onto two thumb drives before retiring from the agency. The OCC said data on the thumb drives were encrypted and there is no evidence that data taken by the employee were \u201cdisclosed\u201d or \u201cmisused.\u201dAn OCC spokesman said the files included information \u201crelated to OCC activities and employees.\u201d He said there is \u201cno indication that there was bank customer information among the files removed.\u201dThe agency said that once it discovered the data breach, it immediately referred the case to the Treasury Department\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s office.
