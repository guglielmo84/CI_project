The students\u2019 1098-T forms, which include their Social Security number and tax identification numbers, among others, were uploaded to the University\u2019s 1098-T Web site. The forms are distributed to WVU students who are U.S. citizens who paid tuition during the 2009 calendar year. They can be used to claim federal tax credit. Students can typically access their forms on the site for tax purposes, but the error made the information viewable to any WVU student on the site.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 39.629526, "Longitude": -79.955897}
