A credit-card encoder and              software to encode the information onto blank cards was also used              to acquire information from ATMs. A former programmer at Birmingham,              Ala.-based Compass Bank stole a hard drive containing 1 million customer              records and used some of that information to commit debit-card fraud.              The thief had used the information stolen from Compass Bank's database              to create about 250 counterfeit debit cards.
