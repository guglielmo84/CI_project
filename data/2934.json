The hiring coordinator            for Dining Services, an OSU student, received an e-mail with an attachment            that included students' names and SSNs. He accidentally            sent the attachment in an e-mail reminding student employees to sign            their waivers for the Ohio Employees Retirement System. After realizing            the mistake, the hiring coordinator called the Office of Information            Technology, which stopped the e-mails before all of them were sent.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 39.961176, "Longitude": -82.998794}
