I discovered the 325k user database through a regular review of search results on the site Shodan.io. The Earbits database was not using any authentication measures. It was completely exposed and available to anyone in the entire world with an Internet connection.We're talking about everything from real names, email addresses, and SHA1 password hashes (with accompanying salts), to the secret access keys of Earbits' Amazon S3 account.\"", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/183-earbitscom-leaks-325000-user-credentials", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 27.099778, "Longitude": -82.454263}
