These faxes were transmitted in connection with the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) services EY provides to Dollar General. Due to the EY tax professional transposing digits in the fax number, the Forms were sent to an unintended recipient's fax machine (instead of the fax machine located at another EY office).", "Information Source": "Security Breach Letter", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2018, "Latitude": 36.323107, "Longitude": -86.71333}
