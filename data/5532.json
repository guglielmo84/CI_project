Although the Washington Post reported that Roberts attributed the database breach directly to a Russian hacker, when pressed by CNN, he said that the Arizona secretary of state's office learned of Russian involvement from internal IT and cyber security staff.\"The information compromised included names, addresses, sex and birthdays, plus voter's social security number or drivers' license numbers. The database that was compromised had information going back 10 years and most likely included outdated information which was never purged.
