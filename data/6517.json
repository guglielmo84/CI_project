It is not clear what type of information the hackers were  targeting. Federal laws meant to safeguard medical information require  companies to disclose any breach involving patient information, so far Boston Scientific has not made these disclosures.Denise Kaigler, a Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs with Boston Scientific stated \"like many companies, Boston Scientific experiences attempts to penetrate our networks and systems and we take such attempts seriously. We have a dedicated team to detect and mitigate attacks when they occur as well as to implement solutions to prevent future attacks.\" Ms. Kaigler would not comment on the specifics of any attack, but described the media reporting as \"inaccurate\". The attacks point to  Chinese hackers and the medical device company was not aware of the  intrusions until federal authorities contacted them and they have now  formed a task force to investigate the breach.", "Information Source": "", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2013, "Latitude": 42.302125, "Longitude": -71.376388}
