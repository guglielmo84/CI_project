The documents came from the now defunct and bankrupt Nursing Visioned Medical Services group. Maryland-based Impulse Monitoring, Inc. bought the assets to NVMS last year when they filed bankruptcy. They said they are not responsible for the patient information because the services NVMS provided were one-time services. The old owners had shredded a bunch of old documents and the more recent ones had been passed on to the company (Impulse) that bought NVMS back in January. It is unclear where the documents came from.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 36.16589, "Longitude": -86.784443}
