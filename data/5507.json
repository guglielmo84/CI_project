The data breach occurred when a new case management  system went live Monday morning. The system was taken down the same  afternoon after an Appeal-Democrat reporter alerted Court Executive  Officer Stephanie Hansel that sensitive and private information was  viewable to the public. For about six hours, anyone who searched for a  criminal or traffic case on public access computers could view the  defendant's Social Security number, birthday, driver's license number  and home address. State court rules clearly say such data should be  redacted by court clerks for the protection of privacy.\"More Information: http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/California-County-Courthouse-Suffers-...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 39.135565, "Longitude": -121.606056}
