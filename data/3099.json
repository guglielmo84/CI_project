Only checking and money-market account information was backed up to the incorrect outside data-storage company. A total of 3,097 customers could have been affected by the backup. Names, addresses, account numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers, would have been available to someone who found them on the Internet. However, the jumble of numbers would not have been easily recognizable and ESB was not identified as the source of the information.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 40.86173, "Longitude": -80.286452}
