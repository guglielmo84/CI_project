Militarysingles.com is owned by ESingles, Inc. \u00a0An ESingles executive claimed that no evidence of an attack had been found as of March 28; however, a number of sources revealed that they could download and decrypt sensitive information by following a Twitter announcement.UPDATE\u00a0(3/28/2012): ESingles released a statement claiming that a thorough investigation revealed that the database had not been hacked. A discrepancy between the number of users in the militarysingles.com database, the use of encrypted user passwords, and the fact that the website was already scheduled to be down for maintenance during the time the hackers claimed to have taken it down led ESingles to this conclusion.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2012, "Latitude": 40.714353, "Longitude": -74.005973}
