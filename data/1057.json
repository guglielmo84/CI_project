Lowercase and uppercase letters are not distinguished and people could even use passwords with extra characters as long as the incorrect characters came after the 8th character of the password.  An example of this problem is that Amazon would accept \"PASSWORD\", \"password\" and \"passwordpassword\" as correct if someone had a password of \"Password\".  The problem appears to affect older Amazon.com passwords that have not been changed recently.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 47.60621, "Longitude": -122.332071}
