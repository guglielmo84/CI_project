This warehouse stored thousands of records for law firms, medical practices, government agencies, financial companies and other businesses.Amongst the charred paperwork were visible Social Security numbers, medical information, bank checks, lawyers' letters, court transcripts and more. Much of the paperwork was strewn out for blocks with clearly visible personal information making it very easy to steal someone's identity. \"New  York City sent disaster recovery contractors, equipped with nets,  shovels and protective boots, to try to collect the debris. But still,  beachcombers sifted freely through the trove of documents, picking their  way through remnants of the days when many records were on paper and  the city government was one of the few takers for north Brooklyn\u2019s  waterfront land.\"                 The various government agencies that stored information at the warehouse included the state court system, the city's Administration for Children's Services and the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
