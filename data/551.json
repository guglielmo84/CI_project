Specifically, it appeared to be an email alerting you that our office had a \u201cDocusign\u201d document waiting for you to review. Upon discovery of this fraudulent activity, we immediately sent an email alerting you not to open the email. We also immediately took action to secure our Gmail account and promptly hired forensic IT specialists to determine exactly what happened and whether any of our other systems were affected. Fortunately, the fraudulent activity was determined to be limited to our Gmail account only. What Information Was Involved? Any  information  you  sent  to  or  received  from  our  office  on  drjsbdpm@gmail.com.  This  could  include  completed  patient  registration  forms  if  you  emailed  them  to  us,  prescription  or  lab  requests,  and  the  content  of  voicemail messages you have left for our office as they would be email transcribed to us for quicker response. We do not send patient records electronically unless specifically requested by a patient so the information is limited to your requests. Further, our office email recipient list, which potentially included your first and last name, and email address may have been exposed.\"More information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-66062", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 32.877956, "Longitude": -117.21008}
