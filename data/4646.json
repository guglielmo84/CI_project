The hacker, who uses the\u00a0handle \u201cthedarkoverlord,\u201d published the premiere episode from the upcoming season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d on Friday to the Pirate Bay.Netflix has set June 9 for the release of\u00a0season five of \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s possible that the streamer will move up the \u201cOITNB\u201d premiere date now that the bulk of the episodes have leaked.Reps for Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about the latest developmentAccording to \u201cthedarkoverlord,\u201d the hacker or hackers also have obtained unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The content appears to have been stolen in an attack on post-production\u00a0studio Larson Studios in late 2016, according to piracy-news site TorrentFreak. \u201cThedarkoverlord\u201d explained in an online post that they obtained only the first 10 of the 13 episodes of \u201cOITNB\u201d season 5 because the cyberattack was carried out before the final three installments were available.In a statement Friday, Netflix said: \u201cWe are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear what impact the theft and piracy of one of Netflix\u2019s top shows will have.\u00a0The hacker (or hacker collective) behind the heist has\u00a0claimed to have\u00a0made an extortion demand to the company, asking for an unspecified sum of money. However, the motive for purloining and leaking \u201cOITNB\u201d could be more about bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.\"", "Information Source": "Maryland Attorney General", "Source URL": "http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/IdentityTheft/breachnotices.aspx?subfolder=2015", "Year of Breach": 2014, "Latitude": 34.099357, "Longitude": -118.331384}
