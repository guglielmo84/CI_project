A spokeswoman for the Omaha-based company said more sensitive              information in the same database, including Social Security numbers              and account numbers, does not appear to have been taken. \"We              were able to conclude that while Social Security numbers are stored              in this particular database, your SSN were not retrieved.\" The              company said names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses              were taken in the data breach.
