Of the more              than 40 million accounts exposed, information on 68,000 Mastercard              accounts, 100,000 Visa accounts and 30,000 accounts from other card              brands are known to have been exported by the hackers. The data exported              included names, card numbers and card security codes.UPDATE (2/23/2006) CardSystems agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it failed to take appropriate security measures to protect sensitive personal information. The company must implement a comprehensive security program and obtain audits every 2 years for 20 years.UPDATE (5/12/2006) CardSystems filed for bankruptcy.UPDATE             (5/28/2009)              Merrick Bank has launched a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Savvis,              accusing the vendor of erroneously telling it that CardSystems Solutions              complied with Visa and MasterCard security regulations less than a              year before the payment processor's systems were hacked, compromising              up to 40 million credit card accounts. Less than a year later the              security breach occurred. Hackers were able to get hold of the data              because CardSystems kept unencrypted card information on its servers              - in contravention of the regulations for which Savvis certified it.
