We recently discovered that our company was the targeted victim of an email spoofing attack on January 20, 2017 in which an individual pretended to be our Chief Executive Officer. A request was made from what appeared to be a legitimate Renovate America email address for all 2016 Renovate America employee W-2 information. Unfortunately, copies of all 2016 employee W\u00ac2 forms were provided before  we  discovered  that  the  request  was  made  from  a  fraudulent  account  by  someone  using  an  email address that appeared to belong to our CEO.  We discovered the fraudulent nature of the request within a few hours and have been working tirelessly to investigate and to mitigate the impact of the attack.What Information Was Involved? A file, including a copy of your IRS Tax Form W-2, was sent in response to the fraudulent emails. An IRS Tax Form W-2 includes the following categories of information: (1) the employee\u2019s  name;  (2)  the  employee\u2019s  address;  (3)  the  employee\u2019s  Social  Security  number;  and  (4)  the employee\u2019s  wage  information.  Other  than  information  contained  on  the  IRS  Tax  Form  W-2,  no  personal financial information was emailed to the external email account.\"More information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-66165", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 32.991459, "Longitude": -117.080199}
