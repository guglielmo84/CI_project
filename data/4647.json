Sabre did not specify when or how the actual intrusion took place or how many records are potentially affected. Sabre does not believe any other system was affected.\"The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity. There is no reason to believe that any other Sabre systems beyond SynXis Central Reservations have been affected,\" the company reported in its quarterly filing and a related press statement.Sabre contacted law enforcement, began notifying affected customers and hired the cybersecurity investigatory firm Mandiant to investigate. According to Sabre\u2019s marketing literature, more than 32,000 properties use Sabre\u2019s SynXis reservations system.Sabre told customers that it didn\u2019t have any additional details about the breach to share at this time, so it remains unclear what the exact cause of the breach may be or for how long it may have persisted, reports Krebs on Security. A card involving traveler transactions for even a small percentage of the 32,000 properties that are using Sabre\u2019s impacted technology could jeopardize a significant number of customer credit cards in a short amount of time.\"", "Information Source": "Maryland Attorney General", "Source URL": "http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/IdentityTheft/breachnotices.aspx?subfolder=2015", "Year of Breach": 2014, "Latitude": 32.941236, "Longitude": -97.134178}
