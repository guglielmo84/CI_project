Knowing that neither they nor we filed the returns, we immediately began an investigation into the matter (specifically, whether the breach was from a  third party or our computers). That same day we contacted our IT consultant, we ensured that all system passwords were changed and user information was secure, and we started running scans and reviewing our systems to identify any malicious malware on our computers. None was found. We then hired a specialized forensic IT firm for additional investigation.On February 16, 2017, the specialized forensic IT firm determined that hackers had gained unauthorized access to our system from a  foreign IP address.   We then notified you of the unauthorized access to your information via email, as a precursor to this letter.  Through investigation we have discovered that the unauthorized access occurred through Remote Desktop Protocol between June 15, 2016 and January 30, 2017.\"More Information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-66802", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 37.559308, "Longitude": -121.956477}
