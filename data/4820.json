The first - a skimmer - went over the            slot where customers insert their ATM cards. The skimmer read, and            stored, the personal information kept in the magnetic strip on the back            of the bank card. The second device was a tiny camera hidden in the lighted            signs over the ATM. The pinhole camera lens pointed directly onto the            ATM keypad and filmed victims typing in their supposedly secret PIN            codes. The thieves would then create their own phony ATM cards and use            their victims' PINs to access accounts.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 40.714269, "Longitude": -74.005973}
