It is the latest casualty of last year's breach              of Heartland Payment Systems, one of the country's largest credit              card processors, where information from more than 100 million credit              and debit card transactions was exposed. Not until the end of May              did Suncoast discover that some of its customers who use Visa Check              Cards could be in danger. The Tampa credit union is issuing new cards              to all members whose accounts were compromised.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 27.947522, "Longitude": -82.458428}
