Upon learning of the incident, Perry & Associates commenced a prompt and thorough investigation and has been working closely with the IRS. Perry & Associates has devoted considerable time and effort to determine whether client data was at risk as a result of the malware. The extensive forensic investigation concluded that a limited number of computer files may have been compromised on November 18, 2017. Since completing the investigation, Perry & Associates concluded that because some computer files may have been compromised, an unknown individual may have had access, via those compromised computer documents, to personal information belonging to clients. Perry & Associates discovered on January 16, 2018 that the information available in the potentially compromised files included client full name and Social Security number, and may have also included driver's license number and bank account information, to the extent that information was provided to Perry & Associates.", "Information Source": "Security Breach Letter", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2018, "Latitude": 33.952602, "Longitude": -84.549933}
