The employee who was assigned the external drive had access to several University network drives. Chapman University cannot determine the actual contents of the missing external disk drive but it is treating the entire content of all drives that the assigned employee had access to as potential content on the missing external drive.\u00a0WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVEDI regret to inform you that a copy of your W9 form was among the content found on the network drives that could have been accessed and downloaded to the external drive. While the content stored on the network drives themselves are secure, the unauthorized back up of these files onto an external disk drive may have put the files at risk of disclosure toan unauthorized person when the external drive was taken.\"", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-103336", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 33.79282, "Longitude": -117.853717}
