In              addition, the investigation found that IRS officials failed to consistently              verify whether contract employees who have access to taxpayer documents              had passed background checks. Further, investigators had difficulty              finding anyone responsible for oversight of most of the facilities              that the IRS contracted with to burn or shred sensitive taxpayer documents.              The review was performed at IRS offices in Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson,              Arizona New Carrollton, Maryland Holtsville, Garden City, and Westbury,              New York and Ogden, Utah, and included questionnaires to 14 Territory              Managers across the country during the period September 2007 through              May 2008.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 38.895112, "Longitude": -77.036366}
