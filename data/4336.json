Atlanta-based Equifax\u2019s W-2Express site makes electronic W-2 forms accessible for download for many companies, including Kroger  \u2014 which employs more than 431,000 people. According to a letter Kroger  sent to employees dated May 5,\u00a0thieves were able to access W-2 data  merely by entering at Equifax\u2019s portal the employee\u2019s default PIN code,  which was nothing more than the last four digits of the employee\u2019s  Social Security number and their four-digit birth year.\"Equifax believes that the Social Security numbers and dates of birth were obtained from another source.More Information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/05/crooks-grab-w-2s-from-credit-bureau-e...", "Information Source": "Krebs On Security", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 33.748995, "Longitude": -84.387982}
