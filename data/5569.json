The leak at PIP printing, which has more than 400 locations in 13 countries, went on for four months before it was repaired Tuesday, cybersecurity experts involved in investigating the breach told NBC News. But there's no evidence that any hackers may have stumbled upon the files to use them for malicious purposes, they add.  The documents, which NBC News examined, ranges from emails revealing credit card and social security numbers to legal filings such as depositions, subpoenas and labor lawsuits. Extensive medical records belonging to high-profile athletes were also at risk.PIP owner Michael Bluestein told NBC News that the breach appeared to stem from a third-party IT firm that accidentally misconfigured the backup protocols \u2014 essentially leaving a \"back door\" open in the system.  \"After discovering the breach, we acted quickly to lock down access to our database,\" Bluestein said. \"We immediately strengthened our security controls. We changed all passwords, took offline all computers that may have been affected and brought in forensic IT experts.\" More information: http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/data-breach-pip-printing-company-lea...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 40.789161, "Longitude": -89.63206}
