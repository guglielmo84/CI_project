We understand from  \ta 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. \t \t \t \t \tTroy Hunt, who runs breach notification site  \tHave I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. \t \t \t \t \tIn  \ta blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. \t \t \t \t \tHunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Dept. of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. \t \t \t \t \tThe US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. \t \t \t \t \tAT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. \t \t \t \t \t\"Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,\" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. \"It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it.\" \t \t \t \t \tHunt ran the exposed database through  \tHave I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database. \t \t \t \t \tThe data is now searchable in  \tHave I Been Pwned. \t \t \t \t \tBut it's not known exactly how the data was exposed, or who is to blame for the leak.\u00a0 \t \t \t \t \tA spokesperson for Dun & Bradshaw would not talk on the record beyond an emailed statement, sent prior to publication. \t \t \t \t \t\"We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day. Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system,\" the statement read.\"More Information: http://www.zdnet.com/article/millions-of-records-leaked-from-huge-corpor...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 40.712784, "Longitude": -74.005941}
