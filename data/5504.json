It was reported that the login credentials of more than 32 million Twitter users  were compromised. According to LeakedSource, which indexes hacked  credentials from data breaches, the credentials are being traded on the  Dark Web for about 10 bitcoin a pop or a little under $6,000. LeakedSource goes on to note that passwords are stored as plain text  files, and many seem to be attached to Russian users. That detail  indicates that the passwords were stolen from users, as opposed to  through a hack into Twitter\u2019s central systems. In response to the leak, Twitter quickly initiated forced resets for many of its users.\"More Information: http://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2016/twitter-account-lockou...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 37.77679, "Longitude": -122.416406}
