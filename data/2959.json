A UMass spokesman declined to say how              many people's records were exposed, except that it was a              large number of undergraduate and graduate students who attended              the university during the 20-year period.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 42.380368, "Longitude": -72.523143}
