Sometime prior to September,              attackers planted keystroke logging malware on Downeast's computer              systems, and stole the credentials the company uses to manage its              bank accounts online. Hackers had gained access to the bank account the company uses to let customers pay for fuel with electronic transfers from their checking accounts. Then, on or around Sept. 2, the hackers used              that access to initiate a series of sub-$10,000 money transfers out              of the company's account to at least 20 individuals around the United              States who had no prior business with Downeast Energy. The personal information to which the thieves had access included customers' names, banks and checking account numbers", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 43.914524, "Longitude": -69.965328}
