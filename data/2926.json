Statement files are delivered to the cardholder through the website            in Adobe PDF format. Because of a load error, the system failed to detect            page breaks between the account statements, thus resulting in the system            believing that all of the pages belonged to a single statement.            As a result, the PDF image file contained 119 statements in addition            to the cardholder's statement. (Note: Monthly account statements            do not include customers' Social Security numbers or PINs.)", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 33.748995, "Longitude": -84.387982}
