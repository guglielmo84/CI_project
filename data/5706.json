It also includes the child's device name -- which is often just their name -- and their device's unique identifier. The data contains the plaintext passwords for the child's Apple ID. Because the app requires\u00a0that two-factor authentication is turned off, a malicious actor viewing this data only needs to use the credentials to break into the child's account to access their personal content data.None of the records contained content data, such as photos or messages, or the locations of either parents or children.The data also contained error messages associated with a failed account action, such as if a parent looking up a child's real-time location didn't complete.Shortly before the server went offline, there were at least 10,200 records from the past three months containing customers data -- but some are duplicates.TeenSafe claims to have over a million parents using the service.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/teen-phone-monitoring-app-leaks-thousands-of-users-data/", "Year of Breach": 2018, "Latitude": 34.052234, "Longitude": -118.243685}
