The            information itself contained Social Security numbers, credit card numbers,            scans of tax forms, business information (including Social Security            numbers and salary information for employees of students' parents),            asylum records and more, all kept in a haphazard and disorganized fashion,            sprawled out in boxes, in unlocked (yet lockable) filing cabinets and            shelving units. If the information inside the room pertained only to            the current students enrolled and their parents that would mean the            story would effect, roughly, forty-two thousand people. However, because            the information goes back at least ten years, if not more, the potential            number of people effect lies well in the hundred thousands.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 42.098687, "Longitude": -75.917974}
