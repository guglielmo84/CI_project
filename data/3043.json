It was a pretty fruitful month and a half for him -- and a pretty costly one to nearly 100 people and several financial institutions. He also used information taken from mail and even some items taken from gym lockers of a couple of hundred more victims. The man eventually stole more than $150,000 from at least eight banks. The man used stolen personal information to create fraudulent identification documents and checks, which he then used to obtain cash, pay for services and buy items. For example, he used one victim's identification to obtain a credit card through U.S. Bank. With that card, he wound up withdrawing $30,529.63 in cash from ATMs throughout Minnesota. Those withdrawals were charged to the victim.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 44.731909, "Longitude": -93.21772}
