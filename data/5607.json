It\u2019s also advising affected users\u00a0to be cautious about any emails from unknown senders as a result. The company says the bug was only active for 24 hours before being patched, and doesn\u2019t believe that the data was misused in any way, at this time.To be clear, Twitter was not hacked nor is this considered a data breach \u2013 instead, the email address or phone number the company had on file for some Vine users was only available under certain circumstances, the company says.The company declined to officially comment on the specifics of how the bug was discovered or how it may\u00a0have been seen by third parties, but we understand that this data\u00a0was not published on the Vine archive website where anyone on the public internet could have seen it. Instead, if anyone was to have seen the data at the time of exposure, they would have had to do so through a more technical means \u2013 such as using an API to pull the information.Twitter is only alerting users out of a desire to be transparent\u00a0in disclosing the vulnerability, not because they believe that anyone actually captured the user data or misused it in any way.\"", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/19/twitter-says-vine-users-emails-and-phone-numbers-were-exposed-for-a-day-but-werent-misused/", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 41.042321, "Longitude": -73.562486}
