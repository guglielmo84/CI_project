A search of the car uncovered a treasure-trove of evidence: a file box full of H&R Block client information, numerous blank W-2 forms, more than 100 debit cards and yellow legal pads with columns of Social Security numbers, PIN numbers, dates of tax filings and whether the returns had been accepted or rejected. The two women stole the identities of more than 60 H&R Block customers from the East Chicago branch. Fraudulent tax returns were then filed in their names since January, and refunds went to bank accounts set up by the two, the complaint alleged. IRS agents have found 17 bank accounts with deposits totaling almost $290,000.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 41.850033, "Longitude": -87.650052}
