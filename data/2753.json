Upon opening it, they found two              enrollment forms. One was an emergency-care authorization form. But              the other was a student information form containing another classmate's              Social Security number, student ID number, home address, phone number              and contact information for his parents at home and at work. They              quickly realized that their child's private information, which              they used to set up their college fund and other accounts, was mailed              to someone else.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2008, "Latitude": 32.93457, "Longitude": -97.251682}
