The man, discovered              financial documents, including customer names, Social Security numbers,              and account information. He was a no-show at a scheduled appearance              in court. The bank won a restraining order against the man, which              ordered him not to talk to bank customers, or disclose what he had              discovered. He disregarded the order and made a documentary about              the discovery.
