A database that included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, and drivers license numbers was accidentally placed online in a publicly accessible place. \u00a0Only people who applied to work for the board in Chicago polling places on Election Day were determined to have been affected. \u00a0A forensic investigation firm believes that as many as 1.7 million registered voters had their names, addresses, and voter registration numbers exposed. However the Chicago Board does not believe that information should be considered sensitive.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2012, "Latitude": 41.878114, "Longitude": -87.629798}
