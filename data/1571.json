Essentially, anyone connecting to a forwarded port on any of our VPN  gateways could have their real IP address leaked to an attacker  specifically targeting a PIA user. Within 12 hours of the initial report, we developed and tested what  we thought was a complete fix, and deployed it to all of our VPN  gateways. On November 26, the researchers who discovered the vulnerability made  it public and we quickly noticed that our service was still vulnerable  to the IP address leak in certain cases, despite our initial fix. After  further investigation, we also realized there was a separate but related  issue on our desktop client. To fix this issue we are releasing updated  VPN apps to prevent any leaks. We released v.52 on November 27.\"The company is recommending anyone who uses their service to make sure they have the most recent release v.52 to avoid vulerability.More information: http://www.databreaches.net/private-internet-access-notifies-customers-o...", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2015, "Latitude": 34.052234, "Longitude": -118.243685}
