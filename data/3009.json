Wake schools mailed about 15,000 reminders asking parents to specify if they want to keep their children in magnet or traditional calendar schools. About a third of those cards had the Social Security Numbers printed alongside the child's name - a holdover from recent years when those nine-digit numbers were used to identify students.
