Spear phishing emails are attempts by an individual or group to solicit specific information from unsuspecting users by employing social engineering techniques. Phishing emails  are  crafted  to  appear  as  if  they  have  been  sent  from  a  legitimate  organization  or  individual.  Our  review  of  network  activity  after  the  email  was  opened  indicated  that  there  may  have  been  unauthorized  access  to  some  company data.
