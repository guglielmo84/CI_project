The lost drive included names, birthdates, and in some cases,              diagnostic information, details of treatments, whether or not patients              had conceived, baby names, and birth weights -- but apparently no              SSNs or financial information.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2008, "Latitude": 44.979965, "Longitude": -93.263836}
