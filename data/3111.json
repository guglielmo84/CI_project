The BEP confirmed to IT PRO that the hosting company it uses experienced an intrusion and as a result of the breach numerous websites were affected, including non-BEP sites. Those URLs are: bep.gov; bep.treas.gov; moneyfactory.gov and moneyfactory.com. BEP has since suspended the website. The chief research officer at IT security company AVG, indicated that the BEP websites had a line of code injected into them. Upon accessing the US Treasury website (treas.gov, bep.gov, or moneyfactory.gov), the iframe silently redirects victims through statistic servers and exploit packs which will carry the victim onto the second stage of the attack. The exploit kit determined that Java was the \u201cbest method\u201d for infecting his test machine. Once infected, users' web browsers will start directing them to ads and \u201cother nasty things\u201d like rogueware.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 38.895112, "Longitude": -77.036366}
