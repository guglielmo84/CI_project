On or about August 1, 2017, we discovered that ABM had become the target of a phishing email campaign. For background, phishing is a type of electronic attack where outside individuals impersonate a trusted person or company to obtain information or install dangerous software. Several ABM employees had clicked on the phishing emails and entered their credentials. As is our protocol, we immediately took steps to secure these employees\u2019 email accounts and launched an in-depth investigation to determine whether any sensitive information was accessed or acquired. We subsequently determined, with the help of outside computer forensic investigators, that an unknown actor had gained access to certain ABM email accounts. ABM determined, after a programmatic and manual review of the contents of the affected email accounts, the types of protected information contained in the affected email accounts and to which individuals the information relates.What Information Was Involved? While we currently have no evidence that the unauthorized individual or individuals actually accessed or acquired your information, we have confirmed that your name accessible within the affected email accounts.\"\u00a0", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-104263", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 40.712775, "Longitude": -74.005973}
