Upon discovery of the theft, we promptly notified the Napa Police Department and will provide whatever cooperation is necessary to identify the perpetrator(s) and hold them accountable. On September 8, 2016, we confirmed that your personal information may have been on the server. In December 2012, Dr. Justin Newberry, DDS, purchased Napa Valley Dentistry, including this server, from Dr. C. Michael Quinn, DDS. The server may therefore contain personal information of Dr. Quinn's former patients who may not currently have a relationship with Napa Valley Dentistry. While there is no indication that your personal information was, in fact, accessed without authorization, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution and offering you identity protection services.\"The information compromised included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and dental insurance information.
