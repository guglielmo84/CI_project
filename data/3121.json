The Web site was disabled on May 17 when the university discovered the flaw. University officials said in a statement that accessing the database would not have been easy, and no direct links to the database were discovered. The information was available so long because the U of L doctor who set up the Web site thought the information was protected by a password and other precautions. U of L was finally notified when someone outside the university sent an e-mail about open access to the information. The Web site was shut down an hour later.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 38.254238, "Longitude": -85.759407}
