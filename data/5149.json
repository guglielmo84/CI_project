The transcript shows government investigators found that over an 18-month period ending Feb.2013, Ngo's customers made approximately 3.1 million queries on Americans.\"Krebs adds, \"That means that if Ngo's clients conducted 3.1 million individual queries, the sheer number of records exposed by Ngo's service is likely to have been many times that number - potentially as many as 30 million records.\"More Information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/court-ventures/UPDATE (2/23/2015): The total number of records indicated here has been changed to 3.1 million by PRC to reflect the approximate number of records queried by Ngo's customers according to the court transcript.
