The server once belonged to Cameron County.CHANNEL 5 NEWS obtained the server from an anonymous source, who described himself as a hacker. He said he found the treasure of information at the 77 Flea Market in Brownsville.\u201cI knew exactly what it was\u2026 I knew exactly what I had from the moment I saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw this and I thought, you know, \u2018This is a major security flaw.\u2019\u201dThe man said he knew the server was still accessible, because all six of its hard drives were still installed. However, he didn\u2019t know at that point what was in it or how easy it would be to break into it.CHANNEL 5 NEWS Chief Engineer Michael Leal evaluated how to get into the 15-year-old server. He loaded a small version of Windows allowing him to see the file system without inputting a password.\u201cRight now, I can see everything on this computer. It\u2019s as though I logged on with Windows and everything\u2019s available to me,\u201d he said.After accessing the file system, Leal said he discovered a law enforcement database easily accessible. \u00a0The database contained hundreds, if not thousands, of case files.\"", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "http://www.krgv.com/story/35502088/investigation-your-life-for-sale", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 25.901747, "Longitude": -97.497484}
