Dacey reached out to DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm and a former federal prosecutor specializing in cybercrimes. Sussmann called Shawn Henry, the president of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, to get his company's help. Within 24 hours of the first signals that something was amiss, CrowdStrike was brought in to install monitoring software to analyze the details of who was responsible. The DNC has also been in contact with the FBI since the hack was discovered.\"\"CrowdStrike designated two groups that gained access to the DNC's info. One, codenamed Cozy Bear, broke into the DNC last summer and had been monitoring the committee's emails and chats. The other group CrowdStrike dubbed Fancy Bear. It hacked into the DNC in April aiming to get opposition research files. The Fancy Bear breach is what tipped off DNC officials. Fancy Bear was able to gain access to all of the DNC's research staff computers.\"More Information: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/russian-government-hackers-broke-into-dnc-servers-stole-trump-oppo-224315#ixzz4Bev49jq9 ", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 38.907192, "Longitude": -77.036871}
