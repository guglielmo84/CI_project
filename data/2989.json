By agency policy, NARA is supposed to destroy the hard drives rather than return them. On two separate occasions the agency sent defective disk drives back to vendors under a maintenance contract, rather than destroying and disposing of them in-house. UPDATE (1/12/2010):There was a rather large amount of data on this hard drive -- as much as two terabytes of data. The NARA is having to, in effect, do a forensic analysis to try to identify individuals and their information. They had a rolling production of notices to individuals. The total had been 26,000, and then their forensic contractor came up with a new group that contained as many as 150,000 names. UPDATE  (1/27/2010) Media stories now put the number of records involved at 250,000.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 38.980666, "Longitude": -76.936919}
