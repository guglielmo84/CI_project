The flash drive was discovered to be missing on November 20, 2015,  and an investigation was immediately launched. Efforts are continuing to  try to locate the missing flash drive, which was lost in an area of the  hospital not accessible to the public. Consequently, hospital officials  do not believe patient data have been acquired or viewed by an external  third party. IU Health Arnett Hospital started sending breach notification letters  to affected patients last week to inform them that some of their PHI  has potentially been compromised. However, no reports of inappropriate  use of the data have so far been received by the hospital. The flash drive was not used to store Social Security numbers,  financial information, or credit card numbers, although spreadsheets  saved on the device included patient names, medical record numbers,  dates of birth, and medical diagnoses.\"More Information: http://www.hipaajournal.com/iu-health-security-breach-29k-8252/", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 40.399672, "Longitude": -86.808588}
