Peacock is suing BridgePoint Technologies for faulty IT services.\u00a0 BridgePoint Technologies was hired in August 2009 and in March of 2010, a breach of C.D. Peacock's virtual private network (VPN) was discovered.\u00a0 The private network was designed to give remote users access to a centralized network. C.D. Peacock was allegedly advised by BridgePoint Technologies to go around the VPN since it could not be fixed.\u00a0 Though BridgePoint Technologies allegedly said that this move would be safe, C.D. Peacock experienced a serious security breach almost immediately.\u00a0 Hackers installed malicious software on its credit card processing system and other network computers in early April 2010.\u00a0 According to the lawsuit, this allowed hackers to \"access the confidential personal data and financial information of\" C.D. Peacock customers.\u00a0 The stolen data was transfered to the hackers' remote system.\u00a0 The breach was discovered in August of 2010.\u00a0 BridgePoint Technologies claimed that it had not received a copy of the lawsuit as of February 10, 2012.
