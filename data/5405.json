One developer discovered a misconfiguration in the site that allowed him to access full names and emails of over 600,000 users who signed up for Kylie Jenner's website.This developer stated \"I\u2019ll admit I downloaded Kylie\u2019s app just to check it out. I also checked  out the website, and just like most developers, I decided to take a  look around to see what was powering the site. After I started digging a  little bit deeper, I found a JavaScript file  namedkylie.min.75c4ceae105ad8689f88270895e77cb0_gz.js. Just for fun, I  decided to un-minify this file to see what kind of data they were  collecting from users and other metrics they may be tracking. I saw  several calls to an API, which of course made sense. I popped one of  those endpoints into my browser, and got an error just liked I expected.\"The developer then logged in with his own username and password and was \"directed to a web page that contained the first and last names and email addresses of the 663,270 people who had signed up for the site.\"More Information: http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/16/kardashian-website-security-issue-expos...\u00a0", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2015, "Latitude": 34.052234, "Longitude": -118.243685}
