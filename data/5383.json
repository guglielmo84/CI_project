They break  into a victim's Starbucks account online, add a new gift card, transfer  funds over -- and repeat the process every time the original card  reloads.\"Starbucks had denied the unathorized activity was a result of a hack or intrusion into its servers. Starbucks has received complaints from customers regarding unauthroized activity and they claim it is\"primarily caused when criminals obtain reused names and passwords from other sites and attempt to apply that information to Starbucks.\" The company will be reimbursing those who had fraudulent charges to their account.
