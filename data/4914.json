A total of 16,000 payment card numbers were not encrypted.UPDATE\u00a0(10/31/2012): Tax records dating back to 1998 were exposed. \u00a0A lawsuit alleging that South Carolina failed to protect citizens of South Carolina and failed to disclose the breach quickly enough was announced on October 31.UPDATE\u00a0(11/05/2012): Trustwave was named as the data security contractor who handled the South Carolina website and added to the group being sued over the breach. \u00a0Trustwave is an international company based in Chicago.UPDATE\u00a0(11/15/2012): Over 4.5 million consumers and businesses may have had their tax records stolen by hackers. \u00a0It appears that Trustwave focused on helping the Southern Carolina Department of Revenue comply with regulations regarding how credit card information is handled. \u00a0Neither Trustwave nor the Southern Carolina Department of Revenue detected the breach.UPDATE\u00a0(11/29/2012): The total number of people or businesses affected was updated to 6.4 million.
