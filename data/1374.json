Further investigation revealed that servers and desktops had been infected across administrative, instructional, and wireless networks. \u00a0Officials believe that it is likely that using a flash drive to transmit information between a campus computer and a personal computer resulted in exposed personal information. \u00a0It appears that the viruses searched and transmitted data to sites in Russia, China, and at least eight other countries. Banking information and any other personal information that may have been accessed by visitors, students, staff, and faculty on campus computers between 1999 and January of 2012 could have been exposed.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2012, "Latitude": 37.77493, "Longitude": -122.419416}
