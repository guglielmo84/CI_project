They became aware of the incident on July 27, 2016, and we are informed that they promptly took action to secure their systems. We immediately requested further information to understand what happened and to determine which, if any, of our patients were affected. On September 14, 2016, we were provided further detail of the events, and learned that the company, MMPC, experienced a ransomware infection. Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands that a ransom be paid to the creator of the malware to remove the restriction. The third party forensic IT firm hired to investigate this incident found no evidence that patient information was viewed, transferred or accessed. However, during the restoration process of their system, MMPC has informed us that one of their backup systems failed causing the loss of consultation notes between July 11, 2016 and July 26, 2016. Given these events, we wanted to notify you of this matter.\"More information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-64977", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 38.083403, "Longitude": -122.763304}
