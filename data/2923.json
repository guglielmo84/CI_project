The error occurred when department            staff last month sent first-quarter reports to businesses that included            a list of former employees receiving unemployment benefits. Because            some companies had laid off a significant number of employees, the reports            were longer than usual, requiring staff members to stuff the envelopes            by hand rather by machine. Some reports were placed in the wrong envelopes.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 40.217053, "Longitude": -74.742938}
