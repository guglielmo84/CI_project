More alarmingly, the attackers have compromised a\u00a0customer support portal for companies using\u00a0Oracle\u2019s MICROS\u00a0point-of-sale\u00a0credit card payment systems.\"\"MICROS is among the top three point-of-sale vendors globally. Oracle\u2019s MICROS division sells point-of-sale systems used at more than 330,000 cash registers worldwide.\u00a0When Oracle bought MICROS in 2014, the company said MICROS\u2019s systems were deployed at some 200,000+ food and beverage outlets, 100,000+ retail sites, and more than 30,000 hotels.The size and scope of the break-in is still being investigated, and it remains unclear when the attackers first gained access to Oracle\u2019s systems. Sources close to the investigation say Oracle first considered the breach to be limited to a small number of computers and servers at the company\u2019s retail division. That source said that soon after Oracle pushed new security tools to systems in the affected network investigators realized the intrusion impacted more than 700 infected systems.\"More Information: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-...\u00a0", "Information Source": "Krebs On Security", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 37.338208, "Longitude": -121.886329}
