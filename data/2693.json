During the investigation, UCSF determined that an              unauthorized movie-sharing program had been installed on one computer              by an unknown individual. Installation of this program required high-level              system access. The computer contained files with lists of patients              from the UCSF pathology department's database. The data included              information such as patient names, dates of pathology service, health              information and, in some cases, Social Security numbers.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2008, "Latitude": 37.77493, "Longitude": -122.419416}
