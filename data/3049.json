The University notified 15,000 students but they don't know exactly how many students were affected. UTEP blames a glitch in a machine used to fold letters when student\u2019s forms were sent out. Some of the forms were folded in such a way that the document shifted on the envelope and allowed for the Social Security numbers to be visible through the mailing window on the envelope.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 31.75872, "Longitude": -106.486931}
