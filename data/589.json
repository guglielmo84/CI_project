On March 2, 2017 an on-line hacker posing as NSC\u2019s CEO emailed the company\u2019s payroll department and directed that copies of employee W-2 forms be sent to him.  Believing the request to come from the CEO, the payroll department forwarded PDF copies of a number of  employee  IRS  W-2  forms  to  the  requestor,  who  was  using  a  false  email  address  that  appeared to belong to NSC\u2019s CEO.  Although this \u201cspoofing\u201d episode was identified for what it was literally moments after the W-2 forms were sent to the hacker, by that point the forms  themselves  had  already  been  shared  with  him  or  her.    At  this  point  we  have  no  indication  that  any  of  the  information  contained  on  the  W-2  forms  that  the  payroll  department was tricked into sharing with the hacker has been misused in any way, but the potential for such misuse certainly exists.What Information Was Involved?This incident involved your 2016 IRS W-2 form, which includes your name, address, social security number, and 2016 income and withholding information.\"More Information: https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/NSC%20Data%20Breach_CA%20Letter_030717_0...?", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 36.835028, "Longitude": -76.298232}
