On May 30th, a district employee emailed a file containing information about all students who were enrolled in the spring term to a colleague working at home due to illness, for a research report that was on a deadline. The district employee used a personal email account to send the data because the file was too large for the district's secure email to send. The employee then typed in the incorrect email address.The information contained in the file included names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, email addresses, student ID numbers, and telephone numbers. The district has set up a Call Assistance Center at 1-888-266-9438 for affected students. The center will be open from 6 a.m to 6 p.m Monday through Friday for 90 days.", "Information Source": "", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2014, "Latitude": 33.953349, "Longitude": -117.396156}
