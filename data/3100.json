The school was contacted by individuals who said there was something awry going on at this scanning site. That's when the school found their records in disarray, and brought them back. The papers included students' names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, some even contained high school transcripts. Chattanooga State went through each item, hand by hand, and found nearly 2000 missing documents from 2007.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 35.04563, "Longitude": -85.30968}
