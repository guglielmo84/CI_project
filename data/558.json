{"Date Made Public": "2017-02-02", "date": "2017-02-02", "Company": "Toys R Us", "City": "Wayne", "State": "New Jersey", "Type of breach": "HACK", "Type of organization": "BSO", "Total Records": 0, "Description of incident": "\"The vendor who manages our Rewards\u201cR\u201dUs loyalty program recently advised us of unauthorized attempts to access Rewards\u201cR\u201dUs loyalty member accounts. It appears this was an effort to fraudulently redeem Rewards coupons beginning in November. We expect this activity is related to previously reported online breaches, not affiliated with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, where thieves stole login names and passwords.  This may be because the thieves know that users tend to have the same password across multiple accounts.What Information Was Involved?Account information may include the loyalty members\u2019 name, email addresses, mailing address and phone number(s). If you have a Geoffrey\u2019s Birthday Club account and it is linked to your Rewards\u201cR\u201dUs account, then information in this account, such as your child\u2019s name and birth date, may have been accessed as well. Please be assured that the Rewards\u201cR\u201dUs profiles and vendor database do not contain credit card numbers, payment or other sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers.\"More information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-66154", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 40.925373, "Longitude": -74.276544}
