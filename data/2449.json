The information              was mailed last month to agencies that submitted a public records              request for the names and addresses of professionals licensed by the              division. The division mailed 28 computer disks to 23 agencies that              use the information as a marketing or promotional tool. The              disks would normally contain only the names and addresses of individuals              licensed through the Division of Professional Licensure and the Division              of Health Professions Licensure. However, the disks also included              Social Security numbers.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2007, "Latitude": 42.358431, "Longitude": -71.059773}
