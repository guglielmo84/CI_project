A USAPA member said that there is a possibility that the sensitive information of pilot family members was also exposed since US Airways collects this information as well. \u00a0US Airways also collects the credit card numbers of passengers, but there were no reports of this information being exposed by the breach. \u00a0USAPA has been working with the FBI since November of 2010 to determine the scope of the breach. \u00a0It is possible that someone could use pilot passport numbers and residential addresses to pose as a pilot and create a threat to national security. USAPA is accusing US Airways of denying the breach and failing to discipline the employee responsible for the breach. US Airways has informed USAPA that it is relying on the assurances of the parties responsible for the data breach that the confidential information will not be misused.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 33.414768, "Longitude": -111.90931}
