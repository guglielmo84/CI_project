Someone anonymously posted the claims on the security            mailing list Full Disclosure. In that post, the hacker claims to have            gotten access to everything -- their databases, confidential documents,            scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009.            They claim they have been in touch with the carrier's competitors            trying to sell the data, but have been unsuccessful. They threatened to sell it to the highest bidder. T-Mobile later confirmed a hacker obtained a document.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 47.610377, "Longitude": -122.200679}
