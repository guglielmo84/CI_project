When\u00a0signing up to sync a single device to multiple numbers, the site offered a series of seemingly random numbers to choose from. But after moving on to review the\u00a0information, the customers who were attempting to sign up for Digits would sometimes see the name, email address and phone number of another T-Mobile subscriber in the registration details.\"More information: http://bgr.com/2016/12/07/t-mobile-digits-security-fail-expose-private-d...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 47.576611, "Longitude": -122.167383}
