{"Date Made Public": "2008-03-17", "date": "2008-03-17", "Company": "Hannaford Bros. Supermarket chain", "City": "Portland", "State": "Maine", "Type of breach": "HACK", "Type of organization": "BSF", "Total Records": 4200000, "Description of incident": "This security breach affects all              of its 165 stores in the Northeast, 106 Sweetbay stores in Florida              and a smaller number of independent groceries that sell Hannaford              products. The company is currently aware of about 1,800 cases of reported              fraud related to the security breach. Credit and debit card numbers              were stolen during the card authorization transmission process. It's              unclear if personal information was exposed. UPDATE             (4/2/2009): An April 2, 2009, news story indicated that between Dec.              7, 2007, and March 10, 2008, hackers stole credit and debit card numbers,              expiration dates and PIN numbers from people shopping at Hannaford              supermarkets. About 1,800 fraudulent charges had been made. UPDATE             (5/14/2009): A federal appeals court has revived a Tampa class-action              suit seeking money for Florida shoppers whose credit and debit card              numbers were swiped in a data breach that hit 109 Sweetbay Supermarkets.              The suit seeks free credit monitoring, credit repair if necessary              and undetermined money damages to be split up among victims of the              breach, including those unaware they were victims. UPDATE             (5/22/2009): A Maine U.S. District Court dismissed most of a class              action lawsuit against Hannaford, finding that there is no way to              value the time and effort that consumers spent in correcting fraudulent              activity resulting from the breach. The case of one named plaintiff              was not dismissed. That plaintiff suffered actual monetary damages              for unreimbursed fraudulent charges.UPDATE (11/2/2011): Federal Appeals Court Holds Identity Theft Insurance/Credit Monitoring Costs Constitute \"Damages\" in Hannaford Breach Case (Oct. 24, 2011) http://tinyurl.com/3kxxmnb. http://tinyurl.com/3jkg489UPDATE\u00a0(3/29/2013): A United States District Court for the District of Maine has denied a motion that would have allowed a lawsuit to proceed as a class action. \u00a0The plaintiffs originally moved to certify the proposed class on September 4, 2012. \u00a0http://tinyurl.com/bsg9xpu", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2008, "Latitude": 43.661471, "Longitude": -70.255326}
