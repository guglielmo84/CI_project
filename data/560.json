In January 2017, we confirmed through the use of our forensic information technology investigation firm, Navigant, that the Lacerte tax system we utilize for maintaining and filing tax returns was compromised by an intruder on October 31, 2016, November 1, 2016, November 5, 2016 ,and November 8, 2016. The attacker managed to hack into our computer system despite the use of firewalls and anti-virus software. This resulted in four tax returns being fraudulently filed. While to date we only have knowledge of four instances of reported problems, Navigant determined that there is the possibility that the personal and financial information of other clients and their dependents, including names, addresses,dates of birth, Social Security numbers,Tax Identification Numbers, employer and salary information ,as well as bank account numbers, were also compromised. Once we confirmed that a breach had taken place, the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department was immediately notified, which referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s San Diego field office. In addition the Internal Revenue Service Treasury Inspector General has been notified of the incident and the Franchise Tax Board\u2019s fraud unit.\"More information: https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-66191", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 32.715738, "Longitude": -117.161084}
