On November 8, 2017, an Academy employee mistakenly sent an internal e-mail with an attachment (subject of email: Reminder! 2017 Difference Card Reimbursement Claims), and one of the spreadsheet tabs included in the attachment contained your personal information. The file containing your personal information was originally on a working document that was stored in a secured drive. The employee needed the information contained on the working spreadsheet document to prepare the email distribution list. The employee failed to remove the spreadsheet attachment before the email was sent. The department has policies, procedures and training in place to prevent inadvertent disclosures, but the mistake still occurred as a result of human error. The Academy\u2019s technical security measures, however, prevented this email from being forwarded from the Academy email system to external addresses. We are not aware of the email being sent to anyone other than Academy employees. The Academy has no reason to believe that any information about you has been misused, but nonetheless wants to make sure you are aware of the issue. Those that are not impacted are not receiving this notification.What Information Was Involved?The attachment to the e-mail contained several spreadsheet tabs, one of which listed your first name, last name, and Social Security number.\"", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-110849", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 37.77493, "Longitude": -122.419416}
