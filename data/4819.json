A notice posted on the DHP Web site acknowledged that the site is              currently experiencing technical difficulties which affect computer              and e-mail systems. Some customer identification numbers, which              may be Social Security numbers, were included, but medical histories              were not. UPDATE (6/4/09):              The state is mailing individual notifications to 530,000 people whose              prescription records may have contained Social Security numbers. In              addition, 1,400 registered users of the database, mostly doctors and              pharmacists, who may have provided Social Security numbers when they              registered for the program, are being notified. The database that was              hacked contained records of more than 35 million prescriptions dispensed              since 2006 for certain federally controlled drugs with a high potential              for abuse.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 37.542979, "Longitude": -77.469092}
