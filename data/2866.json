The computers are a cybersecurity              issue because they may contain personal information like names and              addresses. But Los Alamos claims they did not contain classified information. Also              missing are three computers that were taken from a scientist's home              and a BlackBerry belonging to another employee that was lost in              a foreign country considered sensitive.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 35.88808, "Longitude": -106.306972}
