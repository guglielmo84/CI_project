Briar Group was fined for failing to protect the payment card data of tens of thousands of consumers. In addition to having poor data protection practices like allowing employees to share computer passwords and failing to secure network wireless connections, Briar Group was determined to have not responded appropriately when customer data was compromised.  A lawsuit alleges that hackers installed and used malicious software to obtain customer debit and credit card information from the Briar Group's computers.  The malicious software was on the computers from April 2009 to December of 2009 and the company continued to allow the use of credit and debit cards despite being aware that their computer system had been compromised.  The Briar Group agreed to comply with Massachusetts data security regulations, comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, develop a secure password management system and implement information security measures.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 42.358431, "Longitude": -71.059773}
