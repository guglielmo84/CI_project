The individual demanded a ransom in exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files. We immediately began an investigation and retained a leading computer forensic firm to help us. The forensic firm determined on August 21, 2017, that the unauthorized person may have had access to our computer network for several hours before encrypting our computer files. We terminated the unauthorized access and restored the encrypted files with unaffected back-up files. We did not pay the ransom demanded by the individual.What Information Was Involved?We have no evidence that the unauthorized person viewed or obtained any information that was stored on our computer network. However, your name, address, and Social Security number were included in a document on the network.\"", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-108214", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 38.502469, "Longitude": -122.265389}
