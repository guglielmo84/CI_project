The office is refusing to remove the information for the time being because of limited staff resources.  The treasurer's office also claims that the University was given ample time to edit the data so that student names and financial information were not included. Students who received loans, scholarships and other aid for the 2008-2009 school year had their information posted on the website.  Some people are concerned that con artists could contact the students on the list and pretend to be a lender who holds their student loan information.  Information for 2009-2010 school year spending was also submitted with detailed student information and is scheduled to be uploaded sometime in November.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 40.806862, "Longitude": -96.681679}
