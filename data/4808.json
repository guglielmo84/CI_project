They believe the problem affected less than 0.05% of all              documents. Google identified and fixed a bug where a small percentage              of users shared some of their documents inadvertently. The bug occurred              when the document owner, or a collaborator with sharing rights, selected              multiple documents and presentations from the documents list and then              changed the sharing permissions. The bug did not affect spreadsheets.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2009, "Latitude": 37.386052, "Longitude": -122.083851}
