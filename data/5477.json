{"Date Made Public": "2016-02-09", "date": "2016-02-09", "Company": "Ocean Acquisitions, Inc.", "City": "Lake Charles", "State": "Louisiana", "Type of breach": "PORT", "Type of organization": "MED", "Total Records": 659, "Description of incident": "\"The theft of a laptop computer from the vehicle of an Oceans  Acquisitions employee has resulted in the protected health information  of 659 patients from the Abilene region of Texas being exposed. In May 2015, Oceans Acquisitions confirmed that all portable devices,  including laptop computers, had sensitive data encrypted. In the event  of theft or loss of a device, all PHI stored on that device would be  protected. The encryption would prevent any unauthorized individual from  being able to access stored data. However, the laptop theft occurred on April 9, 2015, a month before  Oceans Acquisitions ascertained that all devices were protected. While  the healthcare provider believed the laptop computer theft did not place  any data at risk of exposure, this has turned out not to be the case. According to a substitute breach notice issued on February 2, 2016,  Oceans Acquisitions determined that the laptop in question did contain  the PHI of 659 individuals, and that those patients potentially had  their PHI exposed. This came to light during an unrelated systems  review, which was not linked to the laptop computer theft. The data were stored in an email account that could be accessed  through the computer. The data exposed included names of patients,  medical record numbers, dates of birth, payer information, medical  diagnoses, and admission dates. No financial information, insurance  data, or Social Security numbers were stored in the email account or on  the laptop.\"More Information: http://www.hipaajournal.com/oceans-acquisitions-laptop-theft-data-breach...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 30.226595, "Longitude": -93.217376}
