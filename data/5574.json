A joint investigation into the employee had been conducted by the FBI and the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s Department.As soon as WVU Medicine University Healthcare became aware of the incident, an internal investigation was launched. Two days later, the employee was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. Information provided to the healthcare provider from law enforcement linked the employee with 113 former patients who had suffered identity theft.The healthcare worker had been employed by WVU Medicine University Healthcare since March 2004 and was required to schedule appointments for patients at both the Berkeley Medical Center in Martinsburg, WV and Jefferson Medical Center in Ranson, WV. The investigation revealed that the inappropriate accessing of medical records first occurred on March 1, 2016. Inappropriate access continued until the notification was received by law enforcement.No evidence was uncovered to suggest that the employee copied ePHI onto a portable device, although Teresa McCabe, vice president of marketing and development, said the employee manually copied data from computer screens and removed that information from the premises. A link between 113 patients and the employee was found, although in total, 7,445 breach notification letters were sent to patients informing them of unauthorized ePHI access.After the investigation confirmed that hospital and HIPAA Rules had been violated, WVU Medicine University Healthcare terminated the employee. A criminal investigation is ongoing and the woman is being prosecuted.The female employee was found to be in possession of driver\u2019s licenses with photos and insurance and Social Security cards, suggesting the stolen information had already been used for identity theft. It is unclear whether those identification documents have been used to fraudulently obtain credit or medical services.All individuals impacted by the incident have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for a period of one year via Kroll. Patients have been encouraged to check their accounts, credit histories, and EoB statements and to alert their financial organizations to the possibility of fraudulent use of their information.\"More information: http://www.hipaajournal.com/berkeley-medical-center-employee-inappropria...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 37.871899, "Longitude": -122.25854}
