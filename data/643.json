On Monday, July 10, 2017, the specialized forensic IT firm determined that there was unauthorized access to our system from a foreign IP address on June 14, 2017. Unfortunately, the forensic IT firm cannot determine which files were accessed so we are notifying everyone whose information was accessible out of an abundance of caution.What Information Was Involved?If Hilderbrand & Clark prepared tax returns for you, the information may have included all information provided to the taxing authorities including your: full name, date of birth, telephone number(s), address, Social Security number, all employment (W-2) information, all 1099 information (including account number if provided to us), driver\u2019s license information (if provided to us), and direct deposit bank account information (including account number and routing information if provided to us).
