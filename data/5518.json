{"Date Made Public": "2016-07-29", "date": "2016-07-29", "Company": "Jefferson Medical Associates, P.A.", "City": "Laurel", "State": "Missouri", "Type of breach": "HACK", "Type of organization": "MED", "Total Records": 10401, "Description of incident": "\"A Laurel clinic has issued a warning to a small group of their patients after a recent data breach of their systems. Jefferson Medical Associates issued a press release stating that privacy events may have compromised certain personal information. Continue reading >>\"I find things that are publicly available on the internet that should probably not be public available,\" said Chris Vickery, a cyber security researcher who lives in Austin, Texas. \"Things like databases that have no password and are configured for public access. \"Vickery said he found a security flaw in a database of Jefferson Medical patient information.\"I was just going through randomly looking at the publicly available, configured for public access databases on those ports, and this one showed up,\" he said. \"When I realized there social security numbers and names and phone numbers and prescription information, it dawned on me that 'hey this probably should not be public if it is real data.' So then I started the process of trying to figure out whose it was.\" Jefferson Medical said Vickery was an unauthorized individual who shouldn't have had access to that information.\"This information is private information,\" said Katie Gilchrist, Jefferson Medical's legal counsel. \"It's federally protected information. It's information that was on our server. This individual accessed it without our permission. He did in secret. There has never been a time when patient information in Jefferson Medical's possession has been just out there for anyone to get to.\"Vickery agrees he shouldn't have had access and said that's why he alerted the clinic to the hole in its security.\"It was as available as a website is,\" Vickery said.Gilchrist said, \"Basically it's like leaving a window unlocked in your house. You leave the house, and you leave a window unlocked. These folks out there think that entitles them to come into the house and look around at all your stuff and then take things with them when they leave. That's just not appropriate.\"Vickery said this isn't a hack because the information was readily available to anyone who knewwhere to look.\"There was nothing to hack,\" Vickery said. \"There simply was no password, no user name, no security features of any sort being used. If you want to use a real analogy, here's a better one. I drove along a country road, a public country road, that not many people drive along, and on the side of the road, there were some records. Jefferson Medical left those records there. I took pictures of them and hunted down Jefferson and told them their records were on the side of the road. There's no crime involved there. That's not hacking. That's simply them being negligent.\"Gilchrist said and internal investigation is ongoing, and Jefferson Medical has already increase security in response to the breach.\"More Information: http://www.wdam.com/story/32712941/security-flaw-may-be-responsible-for-...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2016, "Latitude": 31.685946, "Longitude": -89.141363}
