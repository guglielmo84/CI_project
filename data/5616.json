The Daily spoke to vice president for admissions and records Matt Hamilton Tuesday afternoon, when he said OU IT was aware of the breach and was working to secure the files.OU press secretary Matt Epting provided the following statement late Tuesday night: \u201cThe IT Security team has found no evidence to confirm that there has been a breach by an outside party, and is investigating the scenario that enabled an individual to access the files the individual has claimed to download.\u201dAt no point did The Daily suggest there had been an outside breach, but rather that lax security measures allowed email users more access to educational records than should have been allowed.In just 30 of the hundreds of documents made publicly discoverable on Microsoft Office Delve, there were more than 29,000 instances in which students\u2019 private information was made public to users within OU\u2019s email system. Each instance could constitute a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which gives students control over who can access their educational records.\"", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2017/06/14/security-breach-at-ou-exposes-thousands-of-students-data/", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 35.208504, "Longitude": -97.445681}
