On Oct 24, 2014, we discovered that a third party obtained access to our users\u2019 emails and \u201chashed\u2019 passwords. That means that the passwords were encrypted in such a way that it is nearly impossible for anyone, even us, to read it. However, on Oct 24, 2017, a security researcher informed us of a file containing emails and plaintext passwords which claims the data had come from us (Armor Games) and another company (Coupon Mom). We are investigating whether we are the true source of the breach, since the number of leaked emails/passwords is far less than the number of emails breached on either our system or Coupon Mom\u2019s system in 2013. Our users\u2019 passwords were hashed (this makes it unlikely that they could extract plaintext passwords from our data), and some users are reporting that their passwords were included in this breach though they have never used either site. As we investigate the source of the data in this file, we are taking the precautionary measure of treating this as a data breach of our own users.What Information Was Involved? The information in the file contains 11 million emails and plain text passwords. No financial information, names, addresses, or game data was contained in this document.\"", "Information Source": "California Attorney General", "Source URL": "https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-112355", "Year of Breach": 2014, "Latitude": 33.696361, "Longitude": -117.838988}
