They were  supposed to separate them and send each to the rightful owner. Instead one  person got both. The mistake sent tax forms and Social Security numbers to  strangers. More than 500 landlords work with OACAC. On January 28, 2010, half of  those landlords didn't receive tax forms. The other half got their forms and  someone else's private information.", "Information Source": "Dataloss DB", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2010, "Latitude": 37.215326, "Longitude": -93.298244}
