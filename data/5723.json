(See the full list on our developer site.) It does not include any other data you may have posted or connected to Google+ or any other service, like Google+ posts, messages, Google account data, phone numbers or G Suite content.We discovered and immediately patched this bug in March 2018. We believe it occurred after launch as a result of the API\u2019s interaction with a subsequent Google+ code change.We made Google+ with privacy in mind and therefore keep this API\u2019s log data for only two weeks. That means we cannot confirm which users were impacted by this bug. However, we ran a detailed analysis over the two weeks prior to patching the bug, and from that analysis, the Profiles of up to 500,000 Google+ accounts were potentially affected. Our analysis showed that up to 438 applications may have used this API.We found no evidence that any developer was aware of this bug, or abusing the API, and we found no evidence that any Profile data was misused.", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/", "Year of Breach": 2018, "Latitude": 0.0, "Longitude": 0.0}
