Breaches have\u00a0come\u00a0in many forms and have frequently targeted credit card information, though in some cases personal data has been part of the haul.Now we find ourselves looking at yet another incident. Retail chain Forever 21, which is wildly popular among young people\u00a0in the United States -- you can barely find a mall that doesn't have one -- has officially\u00a0announced\u00a0that its systems were compromised.The extent of the damage is not fully known as of yet. The company posted a brief statement on its website to warn its customers. It seems to downplay the breach to a certain extent, claiming it boosted security back in 2015,\u00a0but\u00a0that some stores hadn't yet been brought up to speed. This resulted in point-of-sale attacks at certain locations. The\u00a0investigation\u00a0is focusing on transactions between March and October of this year.\"", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "https://betanews.com/2017/11/17/forever-21-becomes-the-latest-retail-chain-to-suffer-a-security-breach/", "Year of Breach": 2017, "Latitude": 34.052234, "Longitude": -118.243685}
