This report must be SHREDDED when no longer in use\" was clearly visible at the bottom of each report. \u00a0An administrator accidentally changed the SAISD site settings and exposed the information at an unspecified time. \u00a0The total number of students affected was not reported, but it appears that several reports each contained confidential information for 60-70 students. \u00a0Students appeared in multiple reports.", "Information Source": "Databreaches.net", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2011, "Latitude": 29.424122, "Longitude": -98.493628}
