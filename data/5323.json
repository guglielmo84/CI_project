This script would query iCloud services via the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d API to  guess username and password combinations. The problem here was that  apparently Apple   was not limiting the number of queries. This allowed for attackers to  have numerous chances to guess password combinations without the fear of  being locked out\".The number of celebrity photos or private information breached is still unknown. \u00a0More Information: http://www.forbes.com/sites/davelewis/2014/09/02/icloud-data-breach-hack...", "Information Source": "Media", "Source URL": "", "Year of Breach": 2014, "Latitude": 37.322998, "Longitude": -122.032182}
