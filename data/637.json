Our forensic team was hired right away to conduct an investigation. This led us to believe cybercriminals attacked the remote-access system, used by our outside IT personnel, to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 access our tax filing software around that time. This allowed the cybercriminals to access our system and files, including the use of what appears to be one staff\u2019s credentials.\u00a0 We then discovered that the cybercriminals used the information they obtained to attempt to file fictitious Federal tax returns to fraudulently receive refunds. Fortunately, we were able to inform and work with the Internal Revenue Service. Currently, only Federal tax returns were filed. Unfortunately, as we discussed, such fictitious tax returns were filed for you.\u00a0What information was involved?We are notifying you of this incident because your personal identifying information was accessed or obtained by these cybercriminals.
