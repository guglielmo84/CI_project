We recently discovered that an unauthorized third-party(ies) accessed the accounts of certain employees during various time periods from January 4, 2016 through March 29, 2017. Upon learning of the unauthorized access, TALX and Allegis worked together promptly to understand what happened, and determined that, in some instances, the unauthorized third-party(ies) successfully answered personal questions about the affected employees in order to reset the employees\u2019 PINs (i.e., the password to access the online portal). We have no indication that either TALX or Allegis was the source of any of the information used to reset the PINs and access the accounts.
